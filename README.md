# Poker Simulator
I challenged myself to avoid LLMs to make this. Everything in the project was made from scratch by yours truly. <br>
## Overview
The purpose of this is to create the groundwork for testing poker bot strategies. <br>
This Poker Simulator consists of three main classes: Cards, Player, and Table. <br>
To run a game you must create a new table and add players to the table. Current table max is 10 players. <br>
See *main.py* for example table setup.
## Gameplay
To run a game call the *play_one_hand(deck)* or *play_hands(deck, number_of_hands)* on the table that was created and populated. 
## Shuffling
The shuffling algorithms are made to reproduce the standards used by a professional dealer.
